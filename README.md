Detergent - An emulsifying Erlang SOAP library
==============================================

Detergent helps make SOAP interactions in Erlang
uhh... cleaner (pun totally intended)!

## History

Most code in Detergent was originally extracted
from the SOAP implementation in Yaws, the idea
being to make this more readily available without
having to install Yaws itself.

There are obviously changes in Detergent that
make it different from the Yaws implementation,
and these will continue. Hopefully these changes
make Detergent easier to use.

## Dependencies

Detergent depends on the excellent Erlsom library
for all XML interactions. Erlsom takes away quite
a bit of the pain of working with XML.
